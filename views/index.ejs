<p style="font-size:1.5em; font-family:verdana; margin: 30px; line-height: 200%;">But another hint about Anderson’s hotel comes from a book that Anderson has cited as the spark for the film, Stefan Zweig’s memoir “The World of Yesterday,” an autobiography that he wrote in exile in the early forties, soon before his suicide. During the First World War, the Viennese writer Zweig (1881-1942)—a vehement anti-nationalist and pacifist opponent of the war—occupied a post with the War Archives, and he accepted a mission to collect proclamations issued near the front. On the way back, he travelled by hospital train. In his book, after describing horrific visions of the wounded and the dying, he wrote:

The hospital train in which I was returning arrived in Budapest in the early morning hours. I drove at once to a hotel to get some sleep; my only seat in the train had been my bag. Tired as I was, I slept until about eleven and then quickly got up to get my breakfast. I had gone only a few paces when I had to rub my eyes to make sure that I was not dreaming…. Budapest was as beautiful and carefree as ever before. Women in white dresses walked arm in arm with officers who suddenly appeared to me to be officers of quite a different army than that I had seen only yesterday and the day before yesterday…. I saw how they bought bunches of violets and gallantly tendered them to their ladies, saw spotless automobiles with smoothly shaved and spotlessly dressed gentlemen ride through the streets. And all this but eight or nine hours away from the front by express train. But by what right could one judge these people? Was it not the most natural thing that, living, they sought to enjoy their lives?—that because of the very feeling that everything was being threatened, that they had gathered together all that was to be gathered, the few fine clothes, the last good hours!

Then Zweig got hold of a newspaper from Vienna which was filled with martial hectoring and patriotic bombast:

Here it jumped out at me, naked, towering and unashamed, the lie of the war! No, it was not the promenaders, the careless, the carefree, who were to blame, but those alone who drove the war on with their words. But we too were guilty if we did not do our part against them.

Zweig’s part against the militarists involved writing the anti-war drama “Jeremiah,” which was produced in 1917. He also travelled to Switzerland, where he worked, publicly and privately, with French pacifist authors, such as Romain Rolland and Pierre Jean Jouve. But his vision of the graceful world that the war would destroy was inspired by his stay at a grand Budapest hotel.

Zweig was one of the most acclaimed writers of his time. (Leo Carey recently offered an overview of Zweig’s career in a Critic at Large piece in the magazine.) “The World of Yesterday,” written when he was in flight from the Nazi regime, evokes in sharp and nostalgic detail the artistic and political scene in fin-de-siècle Vienna, the collapse of civic society that followed the First World War, the rise of Hitler, and Zweig’s experience of exile. One of the protagonists of “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is an exile, too: Zero Moustafa (played, as a young man, by Tony Revolori and, later in life, by F. Murray Abraham), a lobby boy whose destiny proves inextricable from that of the hotel itself. When young Zero’s flimsy travel documents are challenged by Nazi surrogates on a train, his friend and mentor, the concierge Gustave H., acts courageously in Zero’s defense. Zweig, too, addressed of the practical difficulties and psychological trauma resulting from the loss of his passport (which, before the First World War, wasn’t even a commonplace document), which, he wrote, turned him into one of “the outlaws, of the men without a country.”

There’s a terrific book forthcoming on the subject: George Prochnik’s “The Impossible Exile: Stefan Zweig at the End of the World,” which I’ve had the pleasure of reading in galleys. (Prochnik is married to the staff writer Rebecca Mead, and they co-authored a Shouts & Murmurs in the magazine.) Prochnik focusses on Zweig’s later years, discussing in detail his wanderings in the nineteen-thirties and forties—to Great Britain, the United States, and his last stop, Brazil. Zweig lived in New York for a while, and Prochnik movingly documents the toll that the author’s peculiar prominence among the Jewish émigré community took on him, especially at a time when millions of Jews who remained in Europe were dying.

It’s strange that, during his time in the United States, Zweig didn’t make his way toward the one place where, perhaps to his discomfort, he’d have been a natural: namely, Hollywood. His fiction has been an inspiration for dozens of movies, and, in “The World of Yesterday,” Zweig details the odd (and unintended) political fallout from Robert Siodmak’s 1933 adaptation of his book “The Burning Secret.” His novel “Fear” was filmed in 1928, again in 1936, and, in a great adaptation by Roberto Rosselini, starring Ingrid Bergman, in 1954. One of the most romantic and superbly styled Hollywood movies, Max Ophüls’s “Letter from an Unknown Woman,” from 1948, is based on a book by Zweig. </p>
